# StateFeedbackControl
Waypoint following controller design for vehicles using feedback controller

•  Vehicle models
•  Waypoint following controller design for vehicles
•  Controller design with state feedback control

▪ Implement the path following controller to drive the simulated vehicle along the given trajectory.
▪ The path following controller produced by this gain matrix performs a PD-control. It uses a PD-controller to correct along-track error for longitude control. The lateral control is also a PD-controller for cross-track error because δθ is related to the derivative of δy.
